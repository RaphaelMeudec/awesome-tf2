# Awesome TF2.x Projects

Starring is not enough and I need to keep track of why repo has interest. So here is a list of TensorFlow 2.x projects on Github that sparked my interest for some reason.

## Optimization & Performance

| Github Project          | Why                                   |
| :--------------------:  | :-----------------------------------: |
| [PyCon SG 2019: Optimize TF perf](https://github.com/tlkh/pycon-sg19-tensorflow-tutorial)  | Setup XLA, MPT on ResNet and Transformers |
| [TensorFlow Profiler](https://github.com/tensorflow/profiler)   | Detailled profiling library in TensorBoard |

## Model Implementations
